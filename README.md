# Raksha-Pipes---Business-Analyst-Assignment

Objective:
The objective of this task was to simulate the operations of Raksha Pipes by generating synthetic data that represents various aspects of the business, such as product inventory, customer interactions, sales transactions, employee information, and financial metrics. By doing so, you've created a dataset that can be used for testing, analysis, and database development purposes.

Steps:-

Data Generation: You've used the faker library in Python to generate synthetic data for various entities such as products, customers, orders, employees, sales, inventory management, financial metrics, and categories.

Data Organization: The generated data has been organized into separate Pandas DataFrames for each entity, making it easier to manage and analyze.

Exporting to CSV: You've exported each DataFrame to a CSV file, enabling easy storage, sharing, and integration with database systems.

ERD Diagram: You've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between different entities in the database schema. This helps in understanding the structure of the database and the connections between various tables.
